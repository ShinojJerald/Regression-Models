# Regression-Models

Regression analysis is a predictive modelling technique that analyzes the relation between the target or dependent variable and independent variable in a dataset. The different types of regression analysis techniques get used when the target and independent variables show a linear or non-linear relationship between each other, and the target variable contains continuous values. The regression technique gets used mainly to determine the predictor strength, forecast trend, time series, and in case of cause & effect relation. 

Regression analysis is the primary technique to solve the regression problems in machine learning using data modelling. It involves determining the best fit line, which is a line that passes through all the data points in such a way that distance of the line from each data point is minimized. There are many types of regression analysis techniques, and the use of each method depends upon the number of factors. Here, I am using Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression.
